# OSCAR Web Services - Audit REST
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a web service for auditing of an OSCAR application that is accessible through a REST API. Authorized clients will be able to make a request to a specific resource on the server over an HTTP protocol. OAUTH will require clients to provide credentials (client id and secret) in exchange for an access token, which will authorize the request.
