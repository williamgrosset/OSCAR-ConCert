		<h2>McMaster Primary Practice Teaching Units</h2>
		<br>
		<font size="-1"> � McMaster Family Practice<br>
		� North Hamilton Community Health Centre<br>
		� Stonechurch Family Health Centre<br>
		<br>
		Beginning in 2002, we will be offering a new and improved weekend
		service. All of the doctors in our three units have formed a weekend
		on-call group. Patients can telephone us directly on the weekend and
		arrange to be seen by the on-call doctor.<br>
		<u>How will the new system work?</u><br>
		If you have a medical problem on the weekend, dial the number for your
		own doctor as usual. If you need to be seen by a doctor, the
		receptionist will arrange a time for you to come to the clinic that
		day. If you call in the evening you will be directed to the usual
		on-call service.<br>
		<u>What are the benefits to patients?</u><br>
		� Increased direct access to a doctor on weekends<br>
		� Convenient, central Weekend Clinic location<br>
		� Acute services available near the Weekend Clinic<br>
		� Lots of street parking<br>
		� Wheelchair accessible<br>
		� Your family doctor will be notified about your visit before the
		office opens Monday<br>
		<u>What about Residents?</u><br>
		Family practice residents will take turns working under supervision at
		the Weekend On-Call Service.
		<p><b>Please remember to bring your health card<br>
		IF YOU HAVE A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING PROBLEM, CALL 911</b>
