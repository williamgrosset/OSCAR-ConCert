<dd>&quot;I have started you with this new medication for your blood pressure. It is really important to make sure that it works for you and is not producing bad side effects. Our clinic pharmacist can monitor this online if you are interested. It is called the MyMeds Study which is being done by a group of researchers at McMaster University. Would you be interested in learning a bit more about it?&quot;</dd>
