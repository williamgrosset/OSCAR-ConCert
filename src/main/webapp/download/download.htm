<p><b>Release Builds</b> are those that are ready for Prime Time.
This build is &quot;as good as it gets!&quot;</p>
<p><b>Nightly Builds</b> are those that are very unstable. We have
no confidence in them. They are for developers who are helping to
develop the technology and want &quot;the latest bits.&quot; Use at your
own risk!</p>
<p><b>Demo Builds</b> are useful for showing demonstrations of our
products. For example, we packaged a sample Clinic application.</p>
